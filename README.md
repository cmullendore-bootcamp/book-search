## Description
A convenient way to search Google Books and save titles that may be interesting to you. You can see the books you've saved and remove a book at any time.

## Installation
- Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running and available
- Clone the repo and CD into the repo folder
- Run `npm run install` to install all necessary dependencies
- run `npm run debug` to start both the client and server together. 
- To start the client or server separately, cd into the respective `/client` or `/server` directory and type `npm run start` to start that component. Note that BOTH components must be running for the project to work. 

## Usage
After starting both the client and server, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3001 to start using the site.

## Contributing
At this point in time we are not accepting outside contributions, but watch this space for changes soon!

## Tests
We currently do basic functional testing as part of our development processes. Automated testing is in the planning phases.
